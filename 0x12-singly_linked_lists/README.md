Linked List in C Programming

From the name, you can easily say that it is used for linking lists together. But to put it in a nice way, you can say that a linked list is the sequence of linked lists which are connected with each other through links. Linked list in C is a linear data structure where the data is stored at different locations and they are linked using pointers. You have to use pointers to implement the linked list data structure.

What is a linked list in C?

A linked list can be defined as a collection of connected nodes. It is a linear data structure. A linked list contains two parts such as:-

    Data Part:- Contains the data of the user.
    Pointer Part:- It points to the next member of the linked list.

In the above image, Head contains the address of the first node. And the last node in the linked list points to NULL.
Nodes are stored at different locations.
Types of Linked List in C:-

There are 3 types of linked list such as:-

    Singly Linked List
    Doubly Linked List
    Circular Linked List

Singly Linked List:-

Singly linked list is the most common linked list among the others. The singly linked list can be traversed only in one direction. It is a collection of ordered sets of elements. In singly linked list, Each node has a data and a pointer to the next node.
